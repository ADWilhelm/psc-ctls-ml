This repository belongs to the owner's master thesis. The goal is to analyze charge transport layers (CTL) of perovskite solar cells (PSC)  using machine learning (ML).

Step 1 is to identify PubChem CIDs for the CTL materials. With those, accessing SMILES will be possible which enables ML analyses. Identify_CID_main.ipynb is an attempt at that.

Sci., 2022, 17, 216–223 Engineered Science \\nDOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.30919/es8d517 Nickel Oxide Embedded with Polymer Electrolyte as Efficient \\nHole Transport Material for Perovskite Solar Cell Monika Srivastava, Karan Surana, Pramod Kumar Singh and Ram Chandra Singh* Abstract The use of organic hole transport material (HTM) is usually quite expensive owing to its synthesis procedure and high purity \\nrequirement. Therefore, we have synthesized an inexpensive, inorganic HTM, nickel oxide (NiO). The perovskite precursor i.e., \\nCH3NH3I were also synthesized and characterized for surface morphology and elemental analysis. Perovskite solar cell (PSC) \\nwas successfully prepared using NiO as the HTM with a supporting layer of polymer electrolyte. The fabricated  sandwich-\\nstructured  PSC  exhibited  an  open circuit  voltage (Voc)  of  0.77  V,  short  circuit  density  (Jsc)  of 18  mA/cm2,  and  an effective \\nphoton conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.13%. Keywords: Perovskite; Polymer electrolyte; Nickel oxide; Perovskite solar cell; Hole transport material. \\nReceived: 14 June 2021; Revised: 23 August 2021; Accepted: 30 August 2021. \\nArticle type: Research article. In the present work, we report the synthesis of perovskite \\n(CH3NH3PbI3) material in ambient conditions. The synthesis \\nof  NiO  was  carried  out  using  a  simple  sol-gel  method. The \\nprepared  materials  were  further  characterized  for  UV–Vis \\nabsorption,x–ray  diffraction  (XRD),  energy  dispersive–ray \\n(EDX),  and  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM).  The \\nprepared sandwich structured PSC with a supporting layer of \\npolymer  electrolyte  resulted  in  a  Voc  of  0.77  V,  Jsc  of  18 \\nmA·cm-2, and PCE of 5.13% in an ambient condition. \\n\\n4. Conclusions \\nThe present work was focused on the fabrication of PSC in a \\nsandwich  configuration  using  NiO  as  HTM  embedded  with \\npolymer  electrolyte  in  an  ambient  condition.  The  rod-type \\nstructured perovskite enabled efficient trapping of photons and \\ngenerated a decent photocurrent. The NiO well served its role \\nof being an efficient inorganic HTM by transporting the holes \\nto the CE via the polymer electrolyte while also suppressing \\nthe electron recombination. The simple sandwich architecture \\nof the PSC led to a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 18 mA/cm2 with an \\noverall PCE of 5.13%. However, the obtained efficiency is low \\nas compared to the ones mentioned in the literature, which is \\nchiefly  attributed  to  the  preparation  of  PSC  at  ambient \\nconditions, the use of polymer electrolyte, and the utilization \\nof  low–cost  techniques,  such  as  spin–coating  and  doctor \\nblading.  The  fabrication  of  PSC  in  laboratory  ambient \\nconditions reflects upon its low cost and its easily processable \\nnature. The low value of FF suggests the modification in the \\narchitecture of the PSC, possibly in the context of a suitable \\npolymer  electrolyte  which  would  also  help  in  lowering  the \\nthe  overall \\njunction \\nphotovoltaic  characteristics.  The  studies  of  PSC  using  only \\nNiO and other HTMs are underway. resistance, improving thereby'"

Hole Transport Material for Perovskite Solar Cell Monika Srivastava, Karan Surana, Pramod Kumar Singh and Ram Chandra Singh* Abstract The use of organic hole transport material (HTM) is usually quite expensive owing to its synthesis procedure and high purity 
requirement. Therefore, we have synthesized an inexpensive, inorganic HTM, nickel oxide (NiO). The perovskite precursor i.e., 
CH3NH3I were also synthesized and characterized for surface morphology and elemental analysis. Perovskite solar cell (PSC) 
was successfully prepared using NiO as the HTM with a supporting layer of polymer electrolyte. The fabricated  sandwich-
structured  PSC  exhibited  an  open circuit  voltage (Voc)  of  0.77  V,  short  circuit  density  (Jsc)  of 18  mA/cm2,  and  an effective 
photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.13%. Keywords: Perovskite; Polymer electrolyte; Nickel oxide; Perovskite solar cell; Hole transport material.

Article type: Research article. In the present work, we report the synthesis of perovskite 
(CH3NH3PbI3) material in ambient conditions. The synthesis 
of  NiO  was  carried  out  using  a  simple  sol-gel  method. The 
prepared  materials  were  further  characterized  for  UV–Vis 
absorption,x–ray  diffraction  (XRD),  energy  dispersive–ray 
(EDX),  and  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM). The prepared sandwich 
structured PSC with a supporting layer of polymer  electrolyte  resulted  in  a  
Voc  of  0.77  V,  Jsc  of  18 mA·cm-2, and PCE of 5.13% in an ambient condition.

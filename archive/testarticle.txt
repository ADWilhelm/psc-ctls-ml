Hole Transport Material for Perovskite Solar Cell Monika Srivastava, Karan Surana, Pramod Kumar Singh and Ram Chandra Singh* Abstract The use of organic hole transport material (HTM) is usually quite expensive owing to its synthesis procedure and high purity 
requirement. Therefore, we have synthesized an inexpensive, inorganic HTM, nickel oxide (NiO). The perovskite precursor i.e., 
CH3NH3I were also synthesized and characterized for surface morphology and elemental analysis. Perovskite solar cell (PSC) 
was successfully prepared using NiO as the HTM with a supporting layer of polymer electrolyte. The fabricated  sandwich-
structured  PSC  exhibited  an  open circuit  voltage (Voc)  of  0.77  V,  short  circuit  density  (Jsc)  of 18  mA/cm2,  and  an effective 
photon conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.13%. Keywords: Perovskite; Polymer electrolyte; Nickel oxide; Perovskite solar cell; Hole transport material.

Article type: Research article. In the present work, we report the synthesis of perovskite 
(CH3NH3PbI3) material in ambient conditions. The synthesis 
of  NiO  was  carried  out  using  a  simple  sol-gel  method. The 
prepared  materials  were  further  characterized  for  UV–Vis 
absorption,x–ray  diffraction  (XRD),  energy  dispersive–ray 
(EDX),  and  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM).  The 
prepared sandwich structured PSC with a supporting layer of 
polymer  electrolyte  resulted  in  a  Voc  of  0.77  V,  Jsc  of  18 
mA·cm-2, and PCE of 5.13% in an ambient condition. 

3. Results and discussion   
The  details  of  characterization  techniques  used  are  given  in 
supplementary information. 3.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
Figure 1 demonstrates the SEM image of MAPbI3 film, which 
depicts  islands  of  well–defined  flowery  rod-like  structures 
illustrating  the  crystalline  nature  of  the  sample.  The  rod-
shaped structures of MAPbI3 are favorable for efficient charge 
transfer applications and act as better light harvesters as these 
rods not only absorb a portion of the wave incident directly on 
it but also the surrounding ones.[33-35] On further magnification, 
it  is  observed  that  these  rods  have  a  porous  surface,  which 
allows the HTM solution to properly seep into the perovskite 
layer,  thus  creating  a  better  interface  for  charge  transfer 
through the HTM. Figure  2  illustrates  the  surface  morphology  of  NiO, 
whereby  the  presence  of  non-uniform  particles  of  different 
sizes can be observed (Fig. 2(a)). Further magnification (Figs. 
2(b)  and  (c))  reveals  the  agglomeration  of  particles  with 
distinctly visible cracks. The agglomeration of particles tends 
to  the  formation  of  granules,  which  challenges  the  uniform deposition  of  the  NiO  solution  on  the  perovskite  layer. 
Consequently, this affects the formation of a proper interface 
between perovskite and NiO. 3.2 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
The  subsequent  layers of  the WE  may have  varying  surface 
roughness as well as porosity. The surface roughness of any 
layer is determined by the Rrms value, i.e., the root means the 
square value of roughness. Rrms are obtained by the standard 
deviation of data from AFM images. The formula for Rrms is 
given by Equation (1): Rrms   =   √∑ N
n = 1 (zn  − z̅)2
N−1 (1) where zn is the height of the nth AFM data and  z̅  represents 
the mean value of zn of the AFM images, while N represents 
the number of AFM data. In this study, all the measurements 
have been performed over films coated on the FTO substrate. 
Figures  3  and  4  represent  the  3D AFM  images  of  FTO 
coated with TiO2 and FTO coated with TiO2/perovskite layer, 
respectively. Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show a wide range of high-
intensity peaks and also the highly porous nature of the TiO2 
layer. When the MAPbI3 layer is spin coated on TiO2 (Fig. 4), 
the surface roughness decreases from 13.9 to 10.7 nm, which 
suggests the proper coverage of perovskite material over the 
TiO2  surface. A  reduction  in  the  high-intensity  peaks  is also 
seen in Fig. 4. Further, the pores (black regions) in TiO2 (Fig. 
3b) almost vanished upon perovskite coating (Fig. 4b). Thus, 
the study of variation in the surface morphology of TiO2 and 
the perovskite layer in terms of roughness also concludes that 
perovskite is properly adsorbed onto the TiO2 layer. Fig. 1 SEM image of MAPbI3 at a scale of (a) 50 µm (1,000x), (b) 10 µm (5,000x), (c) 5 µm (10,000x), and (d) 4 µm (10,000x). 218 | Eng.

The  EDX  microanalysis  technique determines  the  elemental 
composition of a compound by electron microscopy based on 
the generation of characteristic x–rays. As a result, it also helps 
to  analyze the purity  of  a  synthesized sample or  compound. 
The  elemental  analysis  of  the  synthesized  perovskite  is 
depicted  in  Fig.  S2  (supplementary  information),  which 
clearly  shows  the  absence  of  any  foreign  elements,  thereby 
affirming  the  purity  of  the  prepared  material.  The  atomic 
weight percentage of the elements is given in Table 1. Element Series At. No. Table 1. Elemental composition of MAPbI3 in weight %.

of elements nickel (Ni) and oxygen (O) with the atomic weight percent  as  given  in  Table  2.  This  confirms  that  the  sol-gel 
method used for the preparation of NiO is effective. A small 
percentage of impurity in the form of carbon is also present, 
which could have appeared during the sample loading. 3.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies 
The  obtained  XRD  pattern  of  MAPbI3 is  depicted  in  Fig.  5. 
The crystallite size was calculated by using Debye-Scherrer’s 
formula, which is given by Equation (2): (2) 
𝐷 = 𝑘𝜆/𝛽𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜃  
where  k  is  an  empirical  constant  equal  to  0.9,  λ  is  the 
wavelength of the x-ray source = 1.5405 Å, β is the full width 
at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak, and θ is the 
angular  position  of  the  peak.  The  calculated  crystallite  size 
from  the  XRD  pattern  is  45.82  nm,  which  indicates  the 
formation of MAPbI3 nanoparticles. The XRD pattern of the 
perovskite  material  shows  peaks  at  13.26°,  20.56°,  29.03°, 
32.45°,  39.25°,  41.02°,  and  52.91°  which  are  in  close 
the  reported  peaks.[36]  The  2θ  values 
agreement  with 
correspond  to  (100),  (110),  (200),  (210),  (310),  (330),  and 
(004),  respectively,  which  is  indicative  of  cubic  structured 
MAPbI3.  However,  it  also  suggests  the  phase  transition  of 
perovskite material from tetragonal to cubic crystal structure 
which occurs at ~ 67 °C.[37] The hump from 20° to 35° along 
with  the  unmarked  peaks  are  attributed  to  the  presence  of 
amorphous SiO2 (glass slide).[38] 
The XRD pattern of powdered NiO is presented in Fig. 6. As 
observed, three major peaks are observed at 2θ = 38°, 43°, and 
62°  which  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  JCPDS  data Fig. 3 3D AFM image of TiO2 at an average width of (a) 1 µm and (b) 5 µm. © Engineered Science Publisher LLC 2022                                                                                                                                              Eng.

TiO2. Tiny island-type structures of perovskite can be seen in 
the image, which resembles the SEM image of only perovskite 
material  (Fig.  1),  thereby  further  confirming  that  perovskite 
has  covered  the  TiO2  in  its  entirety.  The  rod-type  structure 
formation should help in better trapping of photons as well as 
facilitate an efficient charge transfer. The perovskite layer is 
followed  by  drop–casting  the  NiO  solution.  From  the  SEM 
analysis of the NiO layer (Fig. 7(c)), it is clear that it consists 
of highly aggregated spherical particles, which offers a better 
surface area. Further, it can be observed that NiO covers the 
perovskite layer perfectly with minute cracks. Fig. 5 XRD pattern of MAPbI3. (JCPDS  card  No.  22–1189).[39]  The  corresponding  miller 
indices for the aforementioned peaks are (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and 
(2  2  0),  respectively.[39,40]  The  obtained  pattern  is  further 
indicative of the crystalline nature of the HTM.[41] 3.5 SEM analysis of PSC 
Figure 7(a) represents the porous TiO2 coating on FTO. Owing 
to the mesoporous nature of TiO2, the pores are not visible in 
the  SEM  image.  From  Fig.  7(b),  it  is  clear  that  the  surface 
morphology  changes  upon  spin  coating  of  perovskite  onto Fig. 6 XRD of NiO powder. Fig. 7 The surface morphology of (a) TiO2 layer (b) TiO2/MAPbI3 layer (c) TiO2/MAPbI3/NiO layer. 220 | Eng.

is  shown  in  Fig.  8.  This  image  represents  the  successful 
fabrication of different layers of PSC, i.e., TiO2 which acts as 
electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite as the sensitizer, and 
NiO  playing  the  role  of  HTL,  thus  achieving  a  well-formed 
hetero–junction structure of PSC. However, it should be noted 
that  apart  from  the TiO2  layer,  the thicknesses  of  perovskite 
and NiO are much greater than the optimum one. For instance, 
the reported ideal thickness for the perovskite layer is 200 – 
400  nm  and  that  of  the  HTL  is  <  180  nm.[42,43]  Since,  no 
sophisticated tools were used, controlling the thickness of the 
sensitizer and NiO deposition was not possible. Fig. 8 Cross–sectional view of PSC. 3.6 Photovoltaic performance 
The obtained characteristic of the PSC with an active area of 
0.40 cm2 is shown in Fig. 9. An above-average Voc of 0.77 V 
was obtained with a decently high Jsc of 18 mA/cm2. However, 
the J–V curve did not have the ideal rectangular shape, hence 
a low FF of 0.37 was obtained. The low value of FF indicates 
the non-uniform formation of different semiconductor layers, 
high interface impedance (as observed in the impedance curve, 
Fig.  11),  and  recombination 
losses.  The  non-uniform 
formation of the functional layers is attributed to the use of the 
spin-coating  technique,  which  although  is  cost-effective  but 
probably not suitable for PSC. The calculated PCE in ambient 
conditions was 5.13%. Fermi level of TiO2 increases as the excited electrons from the 
CB of MAPbI3 moves to the CB of TiO2 while the hole moves 
towards  the  VB  of  NiO  (HTM),  which  is  a  wideband  gap 
material. The CB of NiO lies at approximately −2.2 eV, which 
is  much  higher  than  the  CB  of  MAPbI3,  i.e.,  -3.9  eV.[44] 
Therefore, the injection of electrons from the CB of MAPbI3 
into  the  CB  of  NiO  is  not  energetically  favorable,  which 
suggests that HTM also acts as an electron-blocking layer.[45] 
The  addition  of  polymer  electrolyte  after  the  HTM  layer 
improves  the  contact  between  the  sandwiched  electrodes, 
thereby helping the efficient charge transfer through the redox 
-/I-). The redox couple acts as a shuttle to carry the 
couple (I3
electrons, thus regenerating the HTM as well as the perovskite 
sensitizer. The  schematic  diagram  of  the  entire process with 
energy band levels as given in the literature is shown in Fig. 
10. As  evident  from  the  previous  results,  the  use  of  only 
polymer  electrolytes  leads  to  poor  efficiency  (0.9%).[26] 
However,  with  the  addition  of  NiO  as  HTM  between  the 
electrolyte  and  perovskite, 
improve 
drastically. This is evident from the rise in efficiency to 5.13% 
from 0.9%. the  characteristics 3.7 Impedance spectroscopy 
The obtained impedance graph was subjected to curve fitting 
(Fig. 11) where Rs is the series resistance comprising of the 
wires,  FTOs,  and  clips;  Rt  is  the  resistance  at  the  junction 
between WE (blocking layer to dye) and electrolyte while Rc 
is the resistance at the junction between electrolyte and CE.[46] 
The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 11. Fig. 10 Schematic diagram of the charge transfer process in a 
PSC. The  inset  of  Fig.  11  also  presents  the  expanded  initial 
region  of 
impedance  where  the  initial  high-frequency 
impedance is shifted from zero. This shift of 18 Ω accounts for 
the value of Rs. The first partially formed semi-circle gives the 
value of Rc which stands at 24.36 Ω. The low value of junction 
resistance  between  electrolyte  and  CE  suggests  a  smooth 
interface between these two. The value of Rt is rather high, i.e., 
2211.26 Ω, which is expected owing to the use of the polymer 
electrolyte.[46,47]  Nevertheless,  the  well-formed  impedance 
pattern of the PSC shows the proper junction formation and 
smooth charge transfer between the individual components. Fig. 9 J–V characteristic of the PSC. The absorption of photons in the active layer of perovskite 
leads  to  the  generation  of  electron-hole  pairs.  The  excited 
electrons move to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 leaving 
behind a hole in the valence band (VB) of the perovskite.

4. Conclusions 
The present work was focused on the fabrication of PSC in a 
sandwich  configuration  using  NiO  as  HTM  embedded  with 
polymer  electrolyte  in  an  ambient  condition.  The  rod-type 
structured perovskite enabled efficient trapping of photons and 
generated a decent photocurrent. The NiO well served its role 
of being an efficient inorganic HTM by transporting the holes 
to the CE via the polymer electrolyte while also suppressing 
the electron recombination. The simple sandwich architecture 
of the PSC led to a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 18 mA/cm2 with an 
overall PCE of 5.13%. However, the obtained efficiency is low 
as compared to the ones mentioned in the literature, which is 
chiefly  attributed  to  the  preparation  of  PSC  at  ambient 
conditions, the use of polymer electrolyte, and the utilization 
of  low–cost  techniques,  such  as  spin–coating  and  doctor 
blading.  The  fabrication  of  PSC  in  laboratory  ambient 
conditions reflects upon its low cost and its easily processable 
nature. The low value of FF suggests the modification in the 
architecture of the PSC, possibly in the context of a suitable 
polymer  electrolyte  which  would  also  help  in  lowering  the 
the  overall 
junction 
photovoltaic  characteristics.  The  studies  of  PSC  using  only 
NiO and other HTMs are underway. resistance, improving thereby
